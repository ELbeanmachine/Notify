Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.11 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.

I have added a New Tab For the Superbowl just select these sections and you will be able to locate the game for this Sunday. On the cCloud section if you select it you will receive a search screen type in "FOX" and this will bring a list of FOX Channels to show the Game.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
