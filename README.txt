Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.13 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.

I have Updated the "Live TV" Section of the System; I have also lowered the Zen Addon down the pecking order I have had better success with Exodus and Specto. Zen is still a good addon but I have found some links are taking longer to update.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
