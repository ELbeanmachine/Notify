Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.12 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.

I have removed the Superbowl Tab and updated the Purge Packages and Clear Cache section there was issues with that section. I have removed addon that are no longer working.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
