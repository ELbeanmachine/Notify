Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.07 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.
I have updated the stream acceleration to the system and you will not be able to click on the 1080P links without Stuttering on the picture and will correct this issue with few HD Links and updated broken Repositories and links.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
