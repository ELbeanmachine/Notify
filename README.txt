Welcome to this KODI Build

Version 1.05 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.
I have added Zen and updated broken Repositories.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
