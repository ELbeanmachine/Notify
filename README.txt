Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.08 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.

Unfortunatly VIDTIME is no longer being supported, I have removed the ADDON from the main screen and have updated the Live TV Section it contains multiple live links to Live TV channels. In the Live TV section, I have also added Pinoy TV which contains live streams and recorded TV shows from the PI.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
