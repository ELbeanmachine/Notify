Welcome to My KODI Build

Version 1.14 is out and if you have not downloaded it please do.

I have Removed some of the old Repositories that caused issues with updating certain Addons. The Super Repo repository was causing issues and preventing certain addons from updating i.e. Sportsdevil and other vital addons causing them to not refresh their links.

If you have issues with certain addons select the addon and type the letter "C" or hold on to the OK button until you see the "Add-on Information" select it and select Update on the new pop-up window and select the newest update or if there is only one select it, it will relaunch the link opening it up.
